# Tennis-Ball-Game
This project aims to develop a Python-based machine learning system that detects when a tennis ball hits a designated area on a wall and translates this interaction to a virtual white screen on a computer. The system will use a webcam to monitor a 16:9 aspect ratio frame created with colored tape on the wall.
